# Money Printer

A working execution-intelligence and blockchain/digital-asset market monitoring system designed to evaluate market conditions, evidence quality, policy trust, risk, position sizing, and execution decisions before capital is committed.

The platform combines a proprietary algorithm/core framework with an execution-intelligence layer that adds governance, validation, simulation, monitoring, and feedback around the decision process.

The system is intentionally conservative. A `NO_ACTION` decision or `$0` allocation can be a correct result when the available evidence, policy trust, risk conditions, or deployment stage do not justify execution.

---

## Project Vision

The objective is not simply to build another system that generates trading signals.

Money Printer is being designed to answer a more important set of questions:

- Should this signal be trusted?
- How much evidence supports it?
- Is the policy performing consistently?
- Has the policy drifted?
- Is the current market regime appropriate?
- Does the expected opportunity justify the execution risk?
- How much capital should be exposed?
- Should execution happen at all?
- What happened after the decision?
- Should that outcome affect future decisions?

The result is an architecture where intelligence, governance, risk, execution, and feedback operate as a connected system.

The proprietary algorithm/core framework is the analytical backbone.

The execution-intelligence layer surrounds that backbone with evidence, risk, governance, execution controls, validation, and feedback.

# Important Design Principle

The system separates:

```text
SIGNAL
```

from:

```text
PERMISSION TO ACT
```

A signal does not automatically become a trade.

Conceptually:

```text
Signal
   ↓
Evidence
   ↓
Trust
   ↓
Risk
   ↓
Position Size
   ↓
Execution Permission
```

This means the platform can observe an opportunity while still refusing to allocate capital.

---

# NO_ACTION Can Be Correct

You may see outputs such as:

```text
Policy Trust: UNTRUSTED
Execution Decision: NO_ACTION
Capital Allocation: $0.00
```

This does not necessarily indicate a failure.

The system is designed to refuse execution when governance requirements have not been satisfied.

For example:

```text
UNTRUSTED
    ↓
NO_ACTION
    ↓
NO_ALLOCATION
```

can represent correct risk-control behavior.

---

# Execution Intelligence Layers

## Risk Gate

The Risk Gate determines whether current conditions allow an execution decision to continue through the pipeline.

It acts as an early protection layer between intelligence and capital exposure.

---

## Evidence Confidence

The system distinguishes between:

```text
What the system currently observes
```

and:

```text
How much evidence supports that observation
```

A potentially useful result does not automatically mean sufficient evidence exists for deployment.

---

## Policy Learning

The Policy Learning layer uses accumulated observations and outcomes to evaluate how policies behave under different conditions.

The objective is to allow decisions to be evaluated against evidence rather than assumptions alone.

---

## Regime Performance Tracking

Policies can behave differently across market regimes.

The system therefore tracks performance in the context of the conditions under which decisions occurred.

---

## Policy Drift Monitoring

Policy Drift Monitoring evaluates whether policy behavior or performance has moved away from previously observed behavior.

This helps identify policies that may require additional evidence, recalibration, or review.

---

## Policy Trust

Confidence and trust are deliberately separated.

A policy may generate a strong signal while still lacking sufficient validated evidence to deserve deployment.

The Policy Trust layer evaluates whether a policy has earned sufficient trust.

---

## Automatic Policy Recalibration

The recalibration layer provides infrastructure for responding when evidence or policy behavior changes.

The objective is not uncontrolled self-modification.

Recalibration remains part of the broader governance process.

---

## Policy Versioning

Policy changes can be tracked through versions so that decisions and outcomes can be associated with the policy state that produced them.

This supports reproducibility and auditability.

---

## Policy Approval and Deployment

Policy approval is separated from policy generation.

A policy can exist without automatically being authorized for execution.

This provides another control boundary between experimentation and deployment.

---

# Position Sizing

Position sizing occurs after governance and risk checks.

The system can determine that an opportunity exists while still assigning:

```text
Position Size: 0%
Capital Allocated: $0.00
```

when the evidence or policy trust does not justify exposure.

Conceptually:

```text
Signal
   ↓
Evidence Confidence
   ↓
Policy Trust
   ↓
Risk Gate
   ↓
Position Sizing
```

---

# Execution Orchestrator

The Execution Orchestrator coordinates the final execution path.

```text
Algorithm / Decision
        ↓
Evidence
        ↓
Policy Trust
        ↓
Risk Gate
        ↓
Position Sizing
        ↓
Execution Orchestrator
        ↓
NO_ACTION / PAPER / EXECUTION
```

The orchestrator is designed to ensure that execution decisions pass through the required governance layers.

---

# Paper Trading

The Paper Trading Engine allows the system to evaluate decisions without committing real capital.

This provides a mechanism for accumulating evidence about:

- Decisions
- Market regimes
- Policy behavior
- Execution quality
- Potential slippage
- Outcomes
- Failure conditions

before live-capital deployment.

---

# Realistic Execution Simulation

Simple paper trading can overestimate real-world performance.

The realistic execution layer is designed to model execution conditions such as:

- Slippage
- Latency
- Liquidity
- Execution costs
- Partial fills
- Market movement

This helps evaluate the difference between theoretical decisions and realistic execution.

---

# Execution Outcome Validation

A decision is not considered useful simply because it was generated.

The system evaluates what happened after the decision.

This provides evidence for determining whether the original policy behavior was justified.

---

# Execution Outcome Feedback

The architecture closes the loop:

```text
Decision
    ↓
Execution / Simulation
    ↓
Observed Outcome
    ↓
Outcome Validation
    ↓
Feedback
    ↓
Policy Evaluation
```

This allows observed outcomes to contribute to future evaluation.

---

# Counterfactual Analysis

The system also contains counterfactual evaluation components.

These are intended to help answer questions such as:

```text
What happened when the system acted?
```

versus:

```text
What might have happened if the system had not acted?
```

and:

```text
What happened when the system refused to act?
```

This is useful when evaluating whether conservative decisions are actually creating value.

---

# Auditability and Receipts

Several components generate structured outputs and receipts.

The objective is to make decisions easier to inspect and reproduce.

Rather than returning only:

```text
BUY
SELL
NO_ACTION
```

the broader system can preserve evidence around why a decision occurred.

This is important for operator trust, debugging, research, governance, and future production deployment.

# Quick Start

You do **not** need to know Python to run the application.

The easiest way to run it is with Docker.

You need:

1. Git
2. Docker Desktop
3. Access to this repository
4. Any required environment configuration

---

# Step 1 — Install Git

Install Git if it is not already installed.

Verify:

```bash
git --version
```

---

# Step 2 — Install Docker Desktop

Install and start Docker Desktop.

On Windows, Docker Desktop should be running before starting the project.

If using WSL, make sure Docker Desktop has WSL integration enabled.

Verify Docker:

```bash
docker --version
```

Then:

```bash
docker compose version
```

If both commands return version information, Docker is ready.

---

# Step 3 — Clone the Repository

Open a terminal.

Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ourlightnet/money-printer.git
```

Enter the project:

```bash
cd money-printer
```

---

# Step 4 — Create the Environment File

The repository contains:

```text
.env.example
```

Create your local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The real `.env` file is intentionally excluded from GitHub because it may contain private configuration.

If additional credentials are required, add them to your local `.env`.

Never publish the real `.env`.

---

# Step 5 — Start the Application

From inside the project directory:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Docker will build and start the configured services.

The first build may take several minutes because Docker may need to download dependencies.

---

# Step 6 — Check That Everything Is Running

Run:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see the application containers running.

---

# Step 7 — Open the Dashboard

Open a web browser and visit:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

This opens the main Money Printer dashboard.

---

# Step 8 — Backend API

The FastAPI backend is configured to be accessible locally through the project's Docker setup.

In the current development configuration, the API has been used on:

```text
http://localhost:8001
```

When API documentation is enabled, try:

```text
http://localhost:8001/docs
```

If your Docker configuration changes, check:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

to see the currently exposed ports.

---

# Basic Run Guide

For someone who simply wants to run the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ourlightnet/money-printer.git

cd money-printer

cp .env.example .env

docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

---

# Useful Docker Commands

## Start the application

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Start and rebuild

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Check running containers

```bash
docker compose ps
```

## Check all containers, including stopped ones

```bash
docker compose ps -a
```

## Stop the application

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Restart the dashboard

```bash
docker compose restart eth-monitor-dashboard
```

## View recent logs

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100
```

## Watch logs continuously

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Press:

```text
Ctrl + C
```

to stop watching the logs.

This does not stop the Docker containers.

---

# Troubleshooting

## Dashboard Does Not Open

If:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

does not load, run:

```bash
docker compose ps -a
```

Then inspect the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100
```

Try restarting the dashboard:

```bash
docker compose restart eth-monitor-dashboard
```

Then refresh:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

---

## Rebuild After Code Changes

If dependencies or Docker configuration have changed:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Then:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

## API Is Not Running

Check:

```bash
docker compose ps -a
```

Then inspect the API logs using the service name shown in `docker-compose.yml`.

You can also inspect all logs:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100
```

---

# Updating to the Latest Version

Inside the repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Then rebuild if necessary:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

# Security

This repository should never contain real secrets.

Keep the following private:

```text
.env
API keys
API secrets
Exchange credentials
Wallet private keys
GitHub Personal Access Tokens
Passwords
Private signing keys
Private RPC credentials
```

Use:

```text
.env.example
```

to document required environment variables without exposing their actual values.

Before committing changes, always check:

```bash
git status
```

Never commit a real `.env` file.

---

# Current Development Direction

This repository contains the existing working execution-intelligence system.

The next engineering stage is converting and integrating it into a broader production-oriented full-stack application.

The direction is:

```text
Existing Working System
        +
Proprietary Algorithm / Core Framework
        +
FastAPI Architecture
        +
PostgreSQL
        +
Next.js / TypeScript
        +
Docker
        =
Full-Stack Money Printer
```

The goal is **not** to throw away working intelligence modules.

The existing implementation becomes the intelligence core behind cleaner integration boundaries.

Conceptually:

```text
Next.js Frontend
        ↓
FastAPI API
        ↓
Algorithm Interface
        ↓
Proprietary Algorithm

        ↓
Execution Orchestrator
        ↓
Paper / Controlled Execution
        ↓
Outcome Feedback
        ↓
PostgreSQL / Audit / Analytics
```

This allows the working research system to evolve into a secure, maintainable, operator-facing application.

---

# Production Direction

The long-term deployment architecture separates the public application from sensitive execution infrastructure.

```text
                 User / Operator
                       ↓

                       ↓
             Authentication / RBAC
                       ↓
                 Decision Layer
                       ↓
              Private Execution
                       ↓
          Proprietary Algorithm
                       ↓
          Execution Intelligence
                       ↓
              Exchange Adapter
```

Live-capital execution should remain isolated from directly accessible public endpoints.

---

# Research and Validation

This repository contains experimental and research-oriented components.

Results should be interpreted in the context of:

- available observations,
- sample size,
- validation coverage,
- market regime,
- execution assumptions,
- and evidence confidence.

Experimental signals should remain clearly distinguished from sufficiently validated production behavior.

The objective is to build evidence before increasing trust or capital exposure.

# Current Stage

Money Printer has progressed from research and simulation into live-market testing and validation.

The current focus is validating the complete pipeline against real market conditions:

Market Data → Algorithm → Risk Gate → Evidence Confidence → Policy Trust → Position Sizing → Execution Orchestrator → Outcome Feedback.

The system will continue accumulating live evidence, execution outcomes, and performance data as it moves toward production deployment.
